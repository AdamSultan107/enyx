# Enyx Therapeutics (In Progress)

ENYX Therapeutics, LLC, is an early stage biotechnology company focused on using gene therapy tech
nologies to treat hereditary disorders of unmet medical needs. ENYX was founded in January 2022 by R.
Crystal, Chairman, Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell, one of the pioneers of in vivo gene
therapy. ENYX has recruited Dr. Robert Pergolizzi to the position of Scientific Administrator. Dr. Pergolizzi
has extensive experience in molecular biology and gene therapy. He previously supervised core laborato-
ries and instrument facilities at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System (Manhasset, NY), Weill
Cornell Medical College, and currently at the Surgical Sciences Research Laboratory and Vascular Clini-
cal and Research Fellowship program at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center (Englewood, NJ). He is
currently a consultant in Gene Therapy and GMP Vector Production to Enzo Biochem, Inc. (NY, NY), Ae-
gle Biomedical (Princeton, NJ), and Anemoi Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN) and previously filled the same
role for Angion Biomedica (Uniondale, NY). ENYX has also engaged Dr. Yael Strulovici-Barel as Director
of Research. Dr. Strulovici-Barel is a Co-Investigator on this project. ENYX maintains all required registra-
tions to qualify as a small business concern (SBC) eligible for SBIR and STTR applications. ENYX has a

nell personnel will be facilitated by the fact that both are located near Metropolitan Transit Authority Q train
subway stations enabling door-to-door traffic-free transportation between ENYX and Weill Cornell in less
than 30 minutes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
